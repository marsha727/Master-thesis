MSc Thesis

In this repository i represent all the scripts that i used for my master thesis: Comparing soil moisture measurements from three techniques as an indicator for carbon fluxes of peatlands in The Netherlands

Overview:
  -  AFPS calculations: includes all the calculations that were required to calculate the air-filled pore space from the measured values from the direct soil moisture sensors (SENTEK), the tensiometers and OWASIS measurements.
  -  Evapotranspiration: includes the script used to filter the evapotranspiration measurements
  -  Groundwater: includes the calculations used to calculated the groundwaterlevel in NAP
  -  Combine_all_data: includes the scripts used to combine all the data into one dataset so it can be used for plotting and statistical analysis
  -  Interpretation: includes the scripts that were used to create the plots as seen in the report
  -  Non-linear regression: includes the script for the non-linear regression models and assessment of those models
