# Combination of all data

This folder contains the scripts that combine all the data into one dataframe

# Overview
  -  Full dataset: in this script i calculate the integrated AFPS over 20-60 depth range. Furthermore, the script combines: AFPS (SENTEK, TENSIOMETER, OWASIS), Evapotranspiration, groundwater and original LAW_ICOS_MS file.
  -  Statistical file creation: this script combines a smaller set of aggregated dataframes that were extracted from the App (Jan Bierman). This was done for the aggregation of the night-time NEE.
