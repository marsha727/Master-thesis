# Interpretation of data

# AFPS_comparison
This subfolders contains the scripts that are used to analyse how the different measurements (SENTEK, TENSIOMETER and OWASIS) compare to each others. This includes:
  - Correlation plots: Includes a script that computes correlation matrix between the different measurements types with Spearman's rank coefficient
  - Hysteresis plots: Includes a script that was used to visualize the hysteresis between the tensiometer and sentek measurements, a quiver plot style.
  - Segmentation of peaks: Includes a script that was used to extracts peaks of AFPS and can seperate by peak, drying cycle or wetting cycle. The extracted peaks were used to compute correlation matrix for each peak to analyse the hysteresis.

# NEE analysis
This subfolder contaisn the script that was used to plot the relationship between night-time NEE with AFPS. In addition, correlation coefficients between the variables were computed using Spearman's rank coefficient.
